MACHINE LEARNING BASED DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR 
BUILDING ENERGY STAR SCORE PREDICTION



The Energy Star score gives a comprehensive depiction of your buildingâ€™s vitality execution, considering the building's physical assets. It is a simple but powerful tool expressed as a number on a simple scale of 1-100. Based on genuine measured data, energy Star Score evaluates how the buildings is performed by considering its physical properties, operations, and how individuals utilize it. In this work, we predicted the scores  
sing regression (linear regression, Random Forest regression and interpret regression) and classification methodologies (Random Forest Classifier and Interpret Classification). One of the key features is that we can interpret an ensemble of decision trees is through the key features, these can be interpreted as the variable which are most predictive of the target. As we can try to peer into the black box of the model we build, we can know the accurate and predict the score to within 9.1 points. The random forest regressor trained on the training data was able to achieve an average absolute error of 10 points on a hold out testing set, which is significantly better than the baseline measure.
